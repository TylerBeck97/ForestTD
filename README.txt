=================== GamePlay Tips =================== 
-Don't fall behind in upgrading your towers. The creeps
health and speed will increase each level.

-Each tower upgrade increases it's range and doubles it's damage.

-For early waves it's useful to have enough money to place down a tower
should a hole in your defence present itself.

-You will hear three blips to indicate the start of a new wave.

=================== Misc Info =================== 
-Ground creeps speed will increase indefinitely but air creep cap out just
below the missile's speed.

-Music will change at level 6 and level 11

Hopefully you'll enjoy the game and have fun!
